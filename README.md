A simple, clean, and effective flashcard web application designed for language learning. Built with no-fuss HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this tool helps you memorize vocabulary through a customizable, spaced-repetition-style system.

I forged this tool in the fires of procrastination with a single, humble goal: TO BEND ALL HUMAN LANGUAGES TO MY WILL. Soon, I shall be able to order coffee, compliment a stranger's pet, and eloquently insult my enemies in every tongue known to humankind. This app is merely phase one of my global linguistic domination. MWAHAHAHA!
